# Elixir Unicode Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential bug related to Unicode character handling within Elixir's string manipulation functions. The `String.reverse/1` and string comparison operations might produce unexpected behavior when dealing with Unicode characters outside the basic ASCII range.

## Bug Description

The core issue lies in the way Elixir's string functions internally handle Unicode characters. Certain edge cases or specific sequences of Unicode characters could lead to incorrect reversal or comparison results. This can be particularly problematic in applications where internationalization or multilingual support is critical.

## Solution

The solution involves using Elixir's built-in Unicode support to ensure correct handling of all Unicode characters. This might entail employing Unicode-aware string manipulation techniques and libraries, potentially including those provided by the `unicode` library in Elixir.
